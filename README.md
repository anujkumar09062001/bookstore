An online library where people can register their novels and at the same time have access to all the amazing novels belonging to the students on the campus.
This would provide a reader with a huge collection of books and moreover, they would not have to pay such huge amounts of money to buy a book which they might
just read once in their life. To encourage students to update the platform with new books, add a small amount of money for borrowing the book. 

Key inclusions in the Project
